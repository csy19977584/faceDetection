# faceDetection

## About the project  
This project implements face detection and recognition by keras and opencv.  
-Detected faces from video by OpenCV-python.  
-Trained CNN model to recognize faces by Keras-python.  
-Improved accuracy of recognition by changing loss function. Implemented center loss by tensorflow-python instead of softmax loss.
